# Machine translation - text
Feature goal: Building a Japanese -> English translation model
The primary dataset is a Japanese-English Subtitle corpus hosted by Stanford's NLP program: https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/jesc/

A separate dataset features translations of Wikipedia articles covering various topics related to the city of Kyoto

(both datasets contained in this directory as well)

# Machine translation - voice
Feature goal: translating English audio into Japanese audio

# Question & Answer application
Feature goal: Creating a question and answer model that can work with multiple languages
It would be interesting to try this as itâ€™s a fairly new dataset, and making more generalized models to handle different languages seems preferable to using multiple language-specific models
