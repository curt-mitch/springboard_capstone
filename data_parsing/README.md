# Data Parsing Code
The file ``xml_parser.py`` reads through the XML files in the Japanese-English corpus directories.
It extracts the original Japanese sentence and the revised English translation of that sentence and
pairs them together. These sentence pairs then placed in one large array/list and stored to the
file ``sentence_pairs.json`` at the project root directory.
